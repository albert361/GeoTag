Buglets:
* Cursor change upon exiting map?
* double click on map moves point... Can I do anything about that?

Feature Requests:

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

* Often I take a bunch of photos on a walk or a ride, and it is usually a good
  approximation to interpolate the spatial location between the first and last
  photo.  If the intermediate locations could be automatically added based on
  that assumption, they can be tweaked on a finer scale much more easily than
  trying to locate all of them manually.  The math is easy enough, though the
  UI implementation may be a bit hard.  Would greatly appreciate it if you
  could take a shot at it!

* When the Photos app opens up for extensions, I hope GeoTag will be there to
  take advantage of it!  This has become my favorite program in just a few
  hours of use.  [Note: I expect apple to add a map interface to Photos.]
