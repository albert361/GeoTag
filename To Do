Buglets:
* table as first responder as cursor as exit map view
  Map grabs first responder on cursor entry.  I want to have it resign
  first responder on exit.  Or maybe more... copy/cut/delete/paste wont
  work if the map is active, either.
* double click on map moves point... Can I do anything about that?
