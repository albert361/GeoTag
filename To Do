Buglets:
* Cursor change upon exiting map?
* double click on map moves point... Can I do anything about that?

Feature Requests:

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

* When the Photos app opens up for extensions, I hope GeoTag will be there to
  take advantage of it!  This has become my favorite program in just a few
  hours of use.  [Note: I expect apple to add a map interface to Photos.]
