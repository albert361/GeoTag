Buglets:
* Cursor change upon exiting map?
* double click on map moves point... Can I do anything about that?
* Crash reported dragging and dropping video

Feature Requests:
* drag and drop folders... add all images in the folders (and sub-folders)
  Should apply to FIle->Open, too

* Copy originals to a specified backup folder in addition to the trash.

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

* a keyboard shortcut for the „clear list“ command would be nice.

* when appending the file list from several folders an the file names fill
  the list’s space in geotags window, its difficult to append more files if
  there is no more space left below the last file in the list view. maybe you
  can improve geotags drag and drop behaviour.
