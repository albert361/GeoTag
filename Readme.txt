Install GeoTag by dragging it to the folder of your choice.
A link to your Applications folder is provided as that is
a common place to install the program.

Questions, comments, bug reports, rants, raves, and anything
else should be sent to <marc@snafu.org>.  Please include the
internal version number found near the bottom of the About
GeoTag window.  It will look like one of the following:

    #v0.1-8-gb667d81#
    #v0.7#

That will help me determine exactly the version of the code you
are using.
