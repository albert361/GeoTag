## GeoTag 4.3

### New Features

* Add ability to sort the table of images by column.  Clicking on a column header
  will sort the table by the contents of that column.  Clicking again will change
  the sort direction.
* ExifTool version 10.94

### Bug Fixes

* handle the case where the same file name is used for two images located in
  different folders.
* remove GPS date and time stamps when a location is removed.

## GeoTag 4.2

### New Features

* Update GPS Date and Time tags when updating location.   GPS timestamps are
  in GMT.  The procedure assumes the date and time the image was taken was correct
  for the time zone.  If your camera was set to the wrong time zone or set to
  UTC/GMT the GPS timestamp will be incorrect.  This feature is only enabled when
  the 'Update GPS Date/Time stamps' button is checked in program Preferences.
  **This feature is only available on macOS 10.11 or later**
  When running GeoTag on earlier versions of macOS the button state is ignored.
* ExifTool 10.76

## GeoTag 4.0

### New Features:

* Apple maps replace Google maps
* Exiftool is now built in
* Sandboxed for better security
* Image loading is many times faster
* Currently coded in Swift 3

## GeoTag 3.5

### New Features:

* (internal) update code to use Swift 2

### Bug fixes:

* Disable App Transport Security so the maps will load in OS X 10.11
  El Capitan

* location highlighting error fixed.  When assigning a location and then
  selecting another image the latitude and longitude are re-displayed in
  the standard color.

* map search box relocated such that it no longer covers the button used
  to exit street view.

## GeoTag 3.4

### New Features:

* Folders can now be dragged and dropped into the table. All non-duplicate files
  in the folder (and sub folders) will be added to the table for geolocation
  editing.

* Folders can also now be selected in the File -> Open dialog.

* Add âŒ˜K as a shortcut for the Clear image list menu option.  The command
  is ignored if any of the items in the list have been edited and not saved.

* Added a GeoTag preference to select a folder where original files will be
  saved in addition to the Trash. Files in the optional save folder with the same
  name as an image to be saved will NOT be overwritten.

* GeoTag can assign locations to images by interpolating between two points.
  See the operating instructions for more info.

### Bug fixes:

* Window size and split pane locations are now saved.   Restarting GeoTag
  should use the same layout as the previous invocation.

* When using drag-and-drop GeoTag enabled the drop only when the cursor was
  beyond the end of the table.  It will now allow a drop anywhere in the table.
  The added images will still be appended to the end of the table, not placed
  at the cursor location.

* Fixed crash that would occur when dragging movie files into GeoTag

* Fix handling of file systems that do not support the trash.  When the original
  version of an edited file can not be moved to the trash GeoTag will now display
  a warning and leave the original file in its original folder with '_original'
  appended to its name.   The warning will only be displayed once per GeoTag
  execution.

* Minimum window size reduced to fit on the smaller Macbook Air

## GeoTag 3.3

* Add a search field to the map.   Entering the name of a location and then
  hitting enter or clicking on the find button will center the map on the
  searched for location.

* Internal changes to match the requirements/features of Swift 1.2.  Xcode
  version 6.3 or later required to build from source.

## GeoTag 3.2

* Fix a class of bugs that would cause a crash when decoding optional image
  properties than weren't present.

## GeoTag 3.1

* Added ability to resize the image table, image, and map panes.  Otherwise
  the same as 3.0.

## GeoTag 3.0

This is a complete re-write of GeoTag for Mavericks and later

* written in swift
* Assumes exiftool exists in your run path
* Starting map location/zoom level may be saved
* Faster image loading
