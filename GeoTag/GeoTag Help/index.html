<h1>Operating Instructions</h1>

<p>Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or âŒ˜O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files into the table on the left side of the
application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files that can be modified.</p>

<p>Select on one or more rows. When selecting multiple rows the last row selected
has its location (if any) displayed as a pin on the map.  When multiple rows
are selected the latitude and longitude of the row associated with the map
pin will be shown in a yellow.</p>

<p>Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can also be changed by dragging the pin --- click on the pin and hold
until drag mode is enabled.  You may double click on the map to zoom but
pinching (mouse pad) or using the zoom controls may be preferred. The first
click of a double click will always drop a pin at the clicked location,
something that may not be desired.  It this happens you can undo the location
change.</p>

<p>Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported.
When using the Standard map type you can pitch the map for a 3D view.
Pitch changes are not available in Hybrid and Satellite views.  Drag the cursor
over the compass control to change the direction and the pitch.  The amount
of available pitch depends upon the current zoom level.</p>

<p>I you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the maptype, location, and zoom level by clicking on the Save Map Location
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.  Note, however, the that map will always be initialized with North
up and zero pitch regardless of the rotation and pitch when the location
was saved.</p>

<p>The Delete key will remove geolocation information from all selected
images.   You may also cut or copy location information from a single image
and then paste that information into one or more images.  If you make an
error you can undo/redo your changes</p>

<p>Undo/redo information is cleared once changes are discarded or saved.
The original versions of images that have been changed and saved are
in your system trash.  You can restore them from the trash if necessary.
If there are no changes pending save the list of images can be cleared.</p>

<p>Please report any issues to &lt;<a href="mailto:marc@snafu.org">&gt;.</p>
