<h1>Operating Instructions</h1>

<p>Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or âŒ˜O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files.  Such files can be modified.</p>

<p>Select on one or more images. When selecting multiple images the last image
selected is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the window).
Its location (if any) is marked on the map.  When multiple rows are selected
the latitude and longitude of the image displayed in the image well and marked
on the map location will be shown in yellow.</p>

<p>Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can also be changed by dragging the marker. Hitting the delete key
will remove location information from all selected images.  You can Undo/Redo
image location changes.</p>

<p>You may double click on the map to zoom but using the zoom controls may be
preferred as the first click of a double click will always set the image
location to the clicked location, something you may not desire.  You can undo
any undesired location changes.</p>

<p>Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
view.</p>

<p>If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the Save Map Location
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.</p>

<p>You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.</p>

<p>The original versions of images that have been changed and saved are in your
system trash.  You can restore them from the trash if necessary.  If there are
no changes pending the list of images can be cleared.</p>

<p>Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.</p>

<p>Please report any issues to
