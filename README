GeoTag

OS X program (Leopard or later) to add or edit geolocation information
in images by dragging a marker on a google map.   The code was written
before such ability was built in to Aperture and iPhoto.

Xcode 3.x used for project.  Has not been tested with Xcode 4.
A Makefile exists for those, like me, who find some things easier
to do with the command line.

To remove all targets for both the Release and Debug configurations use

    make clean
    
To build a dmg and move it to your desktop use

    make
