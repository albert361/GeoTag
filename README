## GeoTag for OS X

perf branch

* image loading is orders of magnitude faster

maps branch (now merged into the master branch)

* Apple maps replace Google maps
* Exiftool is now built in
* The app is sandboxed for better security
* Currently coded in Swift 3

Note: map searching has not yet been implemented in this version

Because the app is now sandboxed image backups are handled in a different
manner than they were in previous versions.

* If a backup "save" folder has been configured in system preferences a copy
  original file will be placed there **unless a file with the same name
  already exists in that folder**.
* If no "save" folder has been specified the original file will be found in
  the system trash.
* If the image file can not be copied to either location Geolocation
  information will not be saved.   Better to be safe than sorry.

GeoTag is a free OS X single window application that allows you to update image
metadata with geolocation tags by selecting one or more images then panning and
zooming within a google map to the place the image was recorded. Clicking on
the map will add the location to the selected photos using the free exiftool
utility.  Existing location information can be fine tuned by dragging a marker
representing the location in the map.  In either case only image metadata is
changed.

Image metadata modification is performed by the exiftool utility. See
<http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/> for information about
exiftool.GeoTag will check that the tool is installed at start-up.

The functions provided by GeoTag exist in current versions of iPhoto, Aperture
(RIP), and Lightroom.  Some still find the application useful for geolocation
tagging photos in the field.  Photos (OSX 10.10.3 and later) looks like it
will let you modify existing location metadata but not add location data to
an image. If necessary use GeoTag to add location metadata before importing
the images into Photos.

Version 3 of GeoTag is for users of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. Use version
2.2 if your Mac is running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) though OS X 10.8 (Mountain
Lion). Use version 1.8 if your Mac is running OS X version 10.5 (Leopard) or
earlier See <http://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/> for more information.

GeoTag is now available as a [homebrew](http://brew.sh) cask.  Homebrew users
can use the command `brew cask install geotag` to install.

### Operating Instructions:

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files.  Such files can not be modified.   Dragging
or opening a folder will add all the files in the folder and any subfolders.

Select one or more images. When selecting multiple images the last image
selected is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the window).
Its location (if any) is marked on the map.  When multiple rows are selected
the latitude and longitude of the image displayed in the image well and marked
on the map location will be shown in yellow.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can also be changed by dragging the marker. Hitting the delete key
will remove location information from all selected images.  You can Undo/Redo
image location changes.

Double click to zoom in.  Or use the pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

GeoTag can interpolate positions for images between two images with assigned
locations.   This might be useful where you know starting and ending locations
and would like to approximate where on the straight path between the two
other images may have been taken.  To use this feature:

* Load a series of images to be tagged into GeoTag
* Assign a location to the first image in your series of images.
* Assign a location to the last image in your series of images.
* Select all images in the series from first to last.
* Use the menu item "Edit -> Interpolate" to assign location to the
  intermediate images in your series of images.

Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
views.

If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the Save Map Location
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.

You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.

The original versions of images that have been changed and saved are in your
system trash or in their original directory with '_original' appended to the
file name. You can restore them from the trash if necessary.  If there are
no changes pending the list of images can be cleared.

A preference item exists to name a folder where original images will be
copied in addition to the trash.  Files in this folder will not be overwritten
upon subsequent changes to the image.

Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Interpolate, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.

### Build Instructions for developers

* Get current sources from github -- https://github.com/marchyman/GeoTag
* Open the project in Xcode (last built using version 8.3.3)
* ⌘R will build and run, ⌘B to build only
