## GeoTag 3.0

This is a complete re-write of GeoTag for Mavericks and later

* written in swift
* uses Apple's MapKit instead of google maps
* Compiled application signed with an Apple Developer Key

Use version 2.2 if your Mac is running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) though OS X 10.8
(Mountain Lion).  Use version 1.8 if your Max is running OS X version 10.5
(Leopard)  or earlier

The functions provided by GeoTag exist in current versions of Photo, Aperture
(RIP), and Lightroom.  Some still find the application useful for geolocation
tagging photos in the field.
