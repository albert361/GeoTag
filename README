## GeoTag 3.0 -- almost

**Dumb me**: Use of MapKit requires App Store distribution.  I'll either do
that or put back WebKit based maps.  In any case it will take longer to
make a final release than initially planned.

This is a complete re-write of GeoTag for Mavericks and later

* written in swift
* uses Apple's MapKit instead of google maps (**see note above**)
* Assumes exiftool exists in your run path
* Starting map location/zoom level may be saved

Use version 2.2 if your Mac is running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) though OS X 10.8
(Mountain Lion).  Use version 1.8 if your Max is running OS X version 10.5
(Leopard)  or earlier

The functions provided by GeoTag exist in current versions of Photo, Aperture
(RIP), and Lightroom.  Some still find the application useful for geolocation
tagging photos in the field.

### Operating Instructions

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files into the table on the left side of the
application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files that can be modified.

Select on one or more rows. When selecting multiple rows the last row selected
has its location (if any) shown on the map.  When multiple rows are selected the
latitude and longitude of the row associated with the map location will be
shown in a yellow.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can also be changed by dragging the pin --- click on the pin and hold
until drag mode is enabled.  You may double click on the map to zoom but
pinching (mouse pad) or using the zoom controls may be preferred. The first
click of a double click will always drop a pin at the clicked location,
something that may not be desired.  It this happens you can undo the location
change.

Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported.
When using the Standard map type you can pitch the map for a 3D view.
Pitch changes are not available in Hybrid and Satellite views.  Drag the cursor
over the compass control to change the direction and the pitch.  The amount
of available pitch depends upon the current zoom level.

I you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the maptype, location, and zoom level by clicking on the Save Map Location
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.  Note, however, the that map will always be initialized with North
up and zero pitch regardless of the rotation and pitch when the location
was saved.

### Build Instructions

* Open the project in Xcode (6.0 or later required)
* ⌘R will build and run, ⌘B to build only
