GeoTag 2.0

**GeoTag is reported to crash when run under Mountain Lion (10.8)
I'm looking into the issue.**

OS X program (Snow Leopard or later) to add or edit geolocation information
in images by dragging a marker on a google map.   The code was written
before such ability was built in to Aperture and iPhoto.

Leopard (10.5) support was removed after 1.8.   Version 2.0 and later
require Snow Leopard (10.6) or later.   Changes in 2.0 include

* May select and update multiple images at once
* Map zoom level does not change when clicking from image to image (1.8)
* Several misc bug fixes (most in 1.8, too).

For developers: the project now requires Xcode 4.x/Lion as it uses
Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) instead of garbage collection.  This
resolved the issue of messages spit out to the console regarding
underflow when dragging to select in an open panel.

A Makefile exists for those, like me, who find some things easier
to do on the command line.  To remove all targets for both the
Release and Debug configurations use

    make clean
    
To build a dmg and move it to your desktop use

    make
