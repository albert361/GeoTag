GeoTag

OS X program (Leopard or later) to add or edit geolocation information
in images by dragging a marker on a google map.   The code was written
before such ability was built in to Aperture and iPhoto.

The project file was auto converted for use with Xcode 4.1.

A Makefile exists for those, like me, who find some things easier
to do on the command line.  However... the use of the Makefile under
Xcode 4.1 seems to work but I see some nasty stuff logged to the console.
I don't yet trust using the Makefile with Xcode 4.1

The Makefile works fine for those still using Xcode 3.x.
To remove all targets for both the Release and Debug configurations use

    make clean
    
To build a dmg and move it to your desktop use

    make
