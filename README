GeoTag

OS X program (Leopard or later) to add or edit geolocation information
in images by dragging a marker on a google map.   The code was written
before such ability was built in to Aperture and iPhoto.

The project file was auto converted for use with Xcode 4.1.   Some
bug fixes and one changed feature was added for release 1.8... the
map will no longer change zoom levels when a marker is dropped.

Warning for any playing with the code.  In debug you may find the
program stopped on a breakpoint due to auto_refcount_underflow_error.
Strange, as this is a garbage collected program :)  The issue seems
to be a bug in apple code and only occurs when you try to select
multiple items in an open panel by dragging.  In the release code the
"error" is ignored; normal users won't know an issue exists.

A Makefile exists for those, like me, who find some things easier
to do on the command line.  It seems to work OK with Xcode 4.2.
The Makefile works fine for those still using Xcode 3.x.

To remove all targets for both the Release and Debug configurations use

    make clean
    
To build a dmg and move it to your desktop use

    make
