### GeoTag for OS X

GeoTag is a free OS X single window application that allows you to update image
metadata with geolocation tags by selecting one or more images then panning and
zooming within a google map to the place the image was recorded. Clicking on
the map will add the location to the selected photos using the free exiftool
utility.  Existing location information can be fine tuned by dragging a marker
representing the location in the map.  In either case only image metadata is
changed.

The functions provided by GeoTag exist in current versions of Photo, Aperture
(RIP), and Lightroom.  Some still find the application useful for geolocation
tagging photos in the field.  I have not played with Photos (OSX 10.10.3)
enough to know how GeoTag fits with that application.

## GeoTag 3.?

When using drag-and-drop GeoTag enabled the drop only when the cursor was
beyond the end of the table.  It will now allow a drop anywhere in the table.
The added images will still be appended to the end of the table, not placed
at the cursor location.

Add command-K as a shortcut for the Clear image list menu option.  The command
is ignored if any of the items in the list have been edited and not saved.

Fixed crash that would occur when dragging movie files into GeoTag

## GeoTag 3.3

Add a search field to the map.   Entering the name of a location and then
hitting enter or clicking on the find button will center the map on the
searched for location.

Internal changes to match the requirements/features of Swift 1.2.  Xcode
version 6.3 or later required to build from source.

## GeoTag 3.2

Fix a class of bugs that would cause a crash when decoding optional image
properties than weren't present.

## GeoTag 3.1

Added ability to resize the image table, image, and map panes.  Otherwise
the same as 3.0.

## GeoTag 3.0

This is a complete re-write of GeoTag for Mavericks and later

* written in swift
* Assumes exiftool exists in your run path
* Starting map location/zoom level may be saved
* Faster image loading

Use version 2.2 if your Mac is running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) though OS X 10.8
(Mountain Lion).  Use version 1.8 if your Max is running OS X version 10.5
(Leopard)  or earlier

### Operating Instructions

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files.  Such files can be modified.

Select on one or more images. When selecting multiple images the last image
selected is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the window).
Its location (if any) is marked on the map.  When multiple rows are selected
the latitude and longitude of the image displayed in the image well and marked
on the map location will be shown in yellow.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can also be changed by dragging the marker. Hitting the delete key
will remove location information from all selected images.  You can Undo/Redo
image location changes.

You may double click on the map to zoom but using the zoom controls may be
preferred as the first click of a double click will always set the image
location to the clicked location, something you may not desire.  You can undo
any undesired location changes.

Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
view.

If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the Save Map Location
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.

You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.

The original versions of images that have been changed and saved are in your
system trash.  You can restore them from the trash if necessary.  If there are
no changes pending the list of images can be cleared.

Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.
