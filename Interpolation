I received this feature request:

  Often I take a bunch of photos on a walk or a ride, and it is usually a good
  approximation to interpolate the spatial location between the first and last
  photo.  If the intermediate locations could be automatically added based on
  that assumption, they can be tweaked on a finer scale much more easily than
  trying to locate all of them manually.  The math is easy enough, though the
  UI implementation may be a bit hard.  Would greatly appreciate it if you
  could take a shot at it!

It was an interesting problem that was not very difficut to add.  It
may be useful with these caveats:

* travel between start point and end point is assumed to be on a more or
  less straight path.

* The speed of travel between the two points is assumed to be more or less
  constant.

* All images must contain a creation date.   The date the image was taken
  is used to calculate its approximate location.

------------------

To use the feature

* Load a series of images to be tagged into GeoTag
* Assign a location to the first image in your series of images.
* Assign a location to the last image in your series of images.
* Select all images in the series from first to last.
* Use the menu item "Edit -> Interpolate" to assign location to the
  intermediate images in your series of images.
* Save

Undo/Redo works on the entire series of images, not one image at a time.

------------------

For the nerds: the feature works like this

* I added an menu item named “interpolate” to the edit menu and the right
  click menu.   There is also a keyboard shortcut -- ⇧⌘I.

* The menu item is enabled ONLY when three or images are selected and only two
  of the images contain location information.

* When interpolate is chosen from the menu:
  - The distance and bearing between first and last image are calculated
  - The average “speed” in meters/second is calculated
  - for each image that doesn’t have a location
    o calculate the number of seconds between the image and the starting image
    o convert seconds to distance using the average “speed”
    o calculate the approximate location using the start point, initial
      bearing, and calculated distance.
